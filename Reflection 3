This by far was the most difficult activity of them all. In fact, taking a total elapsed time of almost a month. It was not without the guidance of the professor but also the likes of my peers within the class to officially even set the activity up to begin with. What i found most challenging was not even the actual cell coding required; i was able to navigate the teachings of Melanie Walsh to help path my results- it was rather the fixation on trying to actually path the .CSV file (the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Data Set) following the mounting of my google drive. I know i was not the only one who struggled with this aspect thanks to the communication that i channeled with my other classmates. in the end, it was a lengthy but successful process.
